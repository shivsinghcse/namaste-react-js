# React Hook

- read about react folder structure.
- You can keep extension of componenet `.js` or `.jsx`

### import and export

- before importing the component we have to export our component from our file

```js
export default Header;
```

- Now you can import the component

```js
import Header from "./components/Header";
```

- `import Header from "./components/Header";` and `import Header from "./components/Header.js";` both are same.

- Do not keep hard coded data in component files
- keep it in separate files in utils folder file name can be constant.js or config.js, etc

- There are 2 types of `import` abd `export`.
#### Default export 
- Module/file can not have multiple `default` export it can have only one

  ```js
  export default resList;
  ```

 #### Named export 
 - If you have to export multiple things from 1 file, we use named export
  ```js
  export const resImage_CDN_URL = "https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/";
  export const logo_URL = "https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/tasty-food-chef-logo-mascot-template_190190-133.jpg";
```

- Similarly we have 2 types of `import`

#### Default import
```js
    import ResCard from "./ResCard";
```

#### Named Import
```js
import { resImage_CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants";
```

- You can export components as named export

- Yes, you can use both named exports and a default export in the same file ‚Äî it's completely valid JavaScript ES6 syntax.

```js
// Example: Using Both in One File
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

const PI = 3.14159;
export default PI;
//  Import the default export and named exports together:
// App.js

import PI, { add, subtract } from "./utils";

console.log(PI);        // 3.14159
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

- component should not contain more than 100 line (good practice)


### React hooks
- (Normal JS utility functions)
#### State 
State variable - are super powerful variable which re-render ui on update for this we use react hook

- React hooks are normal pre built javascript function given by react which comes with some super powers

- Before use 1st we have to import it.
- There are 2 most important react hooks
  - useState()
  - useEffect()

#### useState
- use to generate Superpowerful Local State variables
- State variable basically maintain the state component

1. import it as named import
```js
import {useState} from "react";
```
2. now we will create state variable
```js
const [state, setState] = useState();
// [state, setState] array destructuring
// useState() retuens an array
// const arr = useState();
// const state = arr[0];
// const setState = arr[1];
```
- whenever a state variable changes react re-render the component.

- React is good at dom operations whenever data layer is updated it updates UI layer very fast.
- It keeps the data layer in sync with UI layer.

- React something uses `reconciliation algorithm` is also known as `React Fiber` comes in react 16 - what it does : 
- When you have UI react create `Virtual DOM` of it.

- Virtual DOM (react element - React.createElement(h1,{},"Hello")- normal js object): 
is a representation of actual DOM (actual dom - tags)

- diff algorithm :
is basicall finds the difference between previous(old) virtual dom and updated virtual dom and update the actual dom on every render cycle.


- Read about react fiber [React Fiber](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture)

### üîÑ React's UI Update Mechanism
#### ‚úÖ React efficiently manages the DOM
- React is optimized for DOM operations.

- Whenever the data layer (state/props) updates, React automatically syncs it with the UI layer (DOM).

- This leads to a fast and responsive user interface.

#### üß† React Fiber (introduced in React 16)
- React uses a Reconciliation Algorithm, known as React Fiber, to handle UI updates.

- It enables incremental rendering, allowing React to pause and resume work‚Äîimproving performance for complex UIs.

#### üå≥ Virtual DOM (VDOM)
- React creates a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy (JS object) of the actual DOM.

- Example:

```js
React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello') 
// This returns a React element (a plain JS object)
```
- The Virtual DOM is not the real DOM, but a representation of it.

#### üîç Diffing Algorithm
- On each render, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one.

- It calculates the minimal number of changes required.

- Then it updates the real DOM efficiently based on this diff.

### Some css tips:

- `overflow: hidden` doesn't apply to `<img>` elements effectively. It should be used on a container (`.logo`) to clip any image overflow.
```css
img {
    width: 100%; /* Makes the image fill its container */
    overflow: hidden; /* Ineffective on <img>; only works on containers */
}
```

- box-shadow:
```css
div{
   box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* horizontal, vertical, blur, color */
}
```
- Keep Fixed Height, but Reposition Image
- If you want to maintain the same card height but adjust how the image is shown inside the crop:
```css
.res-img img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
    object-position: top; /* or center, bottom depending on focus */
    border-radius: 0.7rem;
}
```
ry different values like top, center, or bottom for object-position to get the desired focus area.

###  Lift state up to ResContainer and pass a filter function as a prop.
- Lifting state up is a React pattern where you move the state from a child component to its closest common parent so that multiple components can share and modify that state.

#### üîç Why is this needed?
- In React:

  - Data flows down from parent to child via props.

  - But sometimes a child component needs to update the parent‚Äôs data, or two siblings need to share data.

  - In such cases, you ‚Äúlift the state up‚Äù to their common parent, so it can manage and distribute the data.

#### üìå Rule of Thumb:
- When multiple components need to read or modify the same state, lift it up to their nearest common parent.
